# Research Team Workspace

## Project Overview

Research Team Workspace is a complete full-stack AI project for **Multi-Agent AI** at **Advanced** difficulty. It includes a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, sample documents, vector search with ChromaDB support, source citations, timeline logs, structured run storage, Docker files, and tests.

{'description': 'Research Team Workspace is a platform designed to facilitate collaboration and productivity among research teams. It provides AI-powered tools for analysts and reviewers to streamline research processes, improve accuracy, and enhance decision-making.', 'key_features': ['Collaborative workspace for research teams', 'AI-powered analyst and reviewer tools', 'Automated research process management', 'Real-time feedback and collaboration', 'Enhanced decision-making and accuracy']}

Difficulty controls project complexity, architecture depth, AI model selection, and how advanced the generated codebase is.

- Architecture depth: production-minded FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL + ChromaDB, Docker, detailed README
- Selected architecture: Research Team Assistant
- Template path: templates/multi-agent-ai/research-team-assistant
- Generated stack: FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB, LangChain/LangGraph-ready services, Docker
- README style: detailed architecture, Docker workflow, API examples, and testing notes

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- AI/RAG: LangChain-ready prompt layer, ChromaDB vector storage, local deterministic fallback model
- Workflow: Agent pipeline with planner, retrieval, tool, reasoning, and final answer steps
- Frontend: React and Vite
- Database: SQLite by default, PostgreSQL through Docker Compose
- Testing: pytest
- Difficulty: Advanced

## Generation Method

This project was generated with a template-based architecture engine. AI is used only for the blueprint, domain customization, sample data, prompts, and documentation. The codebase is produced from tested FastAPI/React/Docker templates rather than raw LLM source output.

## Project Type Satisfaction Map

This generated project satisfies **Multi-Agent AI** through the runtime path below. The implementation is not only a README claim: the files listed after the diagram are generated in the repository and validated before GitHub push.

Runtime proof points:

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` renders the user workspace, starter prompts, answer panel, cited sources, and timeline.
- `backend/app/main.py` exposes `POST /api/ask` and returns the final answer, sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- `backend/app/services/pipeline.py` orchestrates the project-type flow: Research Agent, Data Agent, Analysis Agent, DecisionMaking Agent.
- `backend/app/services/vector_store.py` loads sample documents and retrieves relevant cited context.
- `backend/app/domain.py` contains the generated topic-specific workflow steps, business rules, tools, persona, and starter questions.
- `backend/app/db.py` stores each run so the generated app behaves like a real workflow tool instead of a static prompt demo.
- `backend/tests/test_project_contract.py` validates the API contract and project-type behavior.

Type-specific behavior:

- Flow style: Researcher agent -> analyst agent -> reviewer agent -> final synthesized answer.
- Visible output: final answer, cited sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- Validation gate: pytest, frontend build, Docker Compose config, and Docker build before repository upload.

## Environment Variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=false
PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The app runs without an OpenAI key by using a deterministic local answer model. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use LangChain with OpenAI. For CrewAI projects, set `USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=true` after installing dependencies to run the live CrewAI Agent/Task/Crew workflow; otherwise the app uses a deterministic CrewAI-shaped fallback.

For Pinecone projects, add `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` to use a live Pinecone index. Without them, the repo still runs using local ChromaDB/local retrieval fallback.

## Installation

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Run With Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"question\": \"What is the refund policy?\"}"
```

## Example User Question

```text
What should I do if a customer asks for a refund without an order id?
```

## Expected Output

The API returns:

- `answer`: a grounded answer generated from retrieved context
- `sources`: cited document chunks with similarity scores
- `steps`: planner, retriever, reasoning, tool-call, and final-answer timeline logs
- `project_type`: `Multi-Agent AI`

## How The RAG/Agent Flow Works

Researcher agent -> analyst agent -> reviewer agent -> final synthesized answer.

## Project Planner Agent Workflow

User -> React Dashboard -> FastAPI -> Project Planner Agent -> Specialist Agents -> Generated Project -> Auto Testing -> GitHub Repository Creation -> Push Code -> Return GitHub URL

Outputs: Research Project Planning: Define research project objectives and scope; Data Collection: Collect data from research projects; Analysis and Review: Analyze and review research data using AI-powered tools; Decision-Making: Make decisions based on analysis and review results.

## AI-Customized Domain Workflow

- Research Project Planning: Define research project objectives and scope
- Data Collection: Collect data from research projects
- Analysis and Review: Analyze and review research data using AI-powered tools
- Decision-Making: Make decisions based on analysis and review results

## Business Rules

- To ensure effective research process management
- To ensure reliable analysis and review results
- To ensure informed decision-making

1. The backend loads sample documents from `backend/app/data/sample_docs`.
2. Documents are split into chunks.
3. Chunks are embedded and stored in ChromaDB when available, with a local fallback for development.
4. User questions are matched against relevant chunks.
5. Agent-specific steps run: planner, retriever, tool call, reasoning, reviewer, or graph nodes.
6. The final answer is returned with source citations and a timeline.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

## Validation Gates Before GitHub Push
